# SatelliteChangeDetection
Computer Vision Challenge project for satellite image change detection.

## Overview
This project is a MATLAB-based GUI application to detect and visualize large-scale changes between satellite images taken at different times.  

The app enables users to:
- Import time-stamped satellite images
- Automatically align images (rotation, translation, brightness)
- Select and compare earliest vs latest images
- Visualize differences using multiple modes:
  - Difference Map
  - Slider Comparison
  - Overlay Blend
  - Time-lapse Animation
